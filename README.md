# RobloxChat2TXT

A simple python script to download ROBLOX website chats to a TXT file.

Before running, Create a text file in the same directory as the python script and name it 'ROBLOSECURITY.txt'
In this file, insert the ROBLOXSECURITY token that you've extracted from the Roblox.com website.

(If you don't do this beforehand, the script will create the file for you and prompt you to do it then)

Created this because this was the main way I communicated with my friend for several months and I found roblox's chat to be buggy asf when trying to load older messages.
