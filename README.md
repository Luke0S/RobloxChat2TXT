# RobloxChat2TXT

A simple python script to download ROBLOX website chats to a TXT file.

Running the exe version or script will cause a file called 'ROBLOSECURITY.txt' to be created. Fill this in with the .ROBLOSECURITY key from the website.

Created this because this was the main way I communicated with my friend for several months and I found roblox's chat to be buggy asf when trying to load older messages.

This is the source code, but the EXE version can be found <a href="https://github.com/Luke0S/RobloxChat2TXT/tree/main/EXEVersion">here</a><br>
(Partially modified to keep the process clean and coverted with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/">auto-py-to-exe</a>)
